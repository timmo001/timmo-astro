This is a work in progress. I will update this page as I progress.

I am building a matrix display using some matrix WS2812B matrix displays and WLED. I will be using Home Assistant to control the display.

The most recent release of WLED adds 2d matrix support which allows you display effects which suit a 2d display. I plan to use this display to display the weather, time, and other information using WLED's API.

## Parts

- ESP32 or an equivalent ESP chip compatible with WLED.
- 3x 8x32 WS2812B Matrix Displays (These are the ones I used from BTF-Lighting: [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32390846029.html)).
- 3d printed frame (Add published STL files [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5818727)).
- Diffusion Fabric (Used to diffuse the light from the LEDs and to save print effort. You can use whatever works for you).

## Setup
